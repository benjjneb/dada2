# dada2

Exact sample inference from Illumina amplicon data. Resolves real variants differing by as little as one nucleotide.

### DADA2 Articles

Preprint describing DADA2's accuracy and precision: [DADA2: High resolution sample inference from amplicon data](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/024034)

Peer reviewed publication: DADA2: High resolution sample inference from Illumina amplicon data. Nature Methods, in press.

### Installation

The dada2 package binaries are available through Bioconductor:

```S
