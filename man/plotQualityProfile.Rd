\title{Plot quality profile of a fastq file.}
\usage{
plotQualityProfile(fl, n = 5e+05)
}
\arguments{
\item{fl}{(Required). \code{character}.
File path(s) to fastq or fastq.gz file(s).}

\item{n}{(Optional). Default 1,000,000.

\description{
This function plots a visual summary of the distribution of quality scores
as a function of sequence position for the input fastq file(s).
}
\details{
The distribution of quality scores at each position is shown as a grey-scale
heat map, with dark colors corresponding to higher frequency. The plotted lines
show positional summary statistics: green is the mean, orange is the median, and
the dashed orange lines are the 25th and 75th quantiles.
